				Dwarf Digger is a little mining and craft-em-up game that I made for my AP Computer Science Principals class's final exam. To play this game use the w,a,s, and d keys
				to explore around the map. You can click on tiles to mine them, and right click with them selected to place them. To select tiles from your inventory (top-left), use
				the scroll wheel until it's highlighted. Pressing and holding E will open the crafting menu, you can scroll through the recepies and craft them by clicking on them. You 
				will need the materials, and will also sometimes need to be next to a crafting station, like a furnace. After crafting a new pickaxe or other piece of equiment, select it
				and press F to equip it. You can also drop something by selecting it and pressing X.
			</p>
			<p class="generalParagraphs" style="margin-bottom:10px">
				This is by far the most advanced game that I created in highschool. It has a scalable world, that can stretch into all directions as long as you want it too. It does this
				by breaking the world into chunks, so that only certain sections of the world have to be considered in calculations and rendering. Also to save on the very limited memory
				of the chromebook, I had to generate a collision mesh around each block so that blocks surrounded by others didn't have collision, as there would be no way to collide with
				them without first colliding with the surrounding tiles. It uses a tileset for texturing, and a seperate overlay tileset for certain minerals. This was also my very first
				implimentation of an inventory system and a crafting system.
