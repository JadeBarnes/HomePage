					<h1>Zombie Survival</h1>
					<p class="generalParagraphs"> Zombie survival is a game about surviving against zombies, shocking, I know. In this game, you use w,a,s, and d to
					move around the screen. You can fire your weapons with the arrow keys, and switch your held weapon with 1,2, and 3. Replace your currently held weapon and find new ones by walking into
					the blue pickups, multicolored pickups are rare, but give super weapons. You can explore around the map (pictured to the right) by walking off the side of the scene. Avoid zombies,
					and make your way to the exit, the golden square. Once you get there you will need an explosive to break into it. Try to get the highscore!</p>
					
					<p class="generalParagraphs"> This game was created in JavaScript when I was a Junior in highschool. After I created the platformer game, I wanted 
					to create another game that was accessible to other students on their chromebooks. After I created the llnking page between them I created this game.
					This game was my first time experimenting with incorperating HTML elements into the design, including mulptiple canvases, weapon and health text, etc.
					Thi game also uses some more advanced features, like a minimap, chunks, and a large list of differant weapons. 
					</p>
					
					<p class="generalParagraphs"> I sent this game out to my friends and told them about it. It wasn't nearly as popular as the criticly acclaimed Platformer,
					but I did manage to really interest one person in particular. I'll call him Hunter for privacy reasons. Hunter sat next to me in one of my classes and would
					sometimes watched as I programmed this game. Eventually he became really curious about how the game functioned. One day he asked about the guns in the game, and
					how I implimented them. He asked me to E-mail my code to him, which I did, then a bit later he emailed me back a <i>modded</i> version of the game. He added in 
					a whole new weapon, the submachine gun. I incorperated it into the official build, I never had someone take such interest in my projects before.
