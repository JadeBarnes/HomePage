					<h2> Brief Autobiography </h2>
					
					<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
						I was born into a family of 12, and am the youngest of my siblings.
						Conditions growing up were very traumatic for us and our household was a chaotic place to be.
						Mental health issues plagued my early life all the way through highschool.
						This had a negetive impact on my grades throughout school, and I was too disociated to change that fact.
						Despite mental health problems, I have always been a very ambitious person.
						I would self-teach myself topics growing up that I had interests in, such as chemistry, astronomy, and astrophysics.
						I was accepted into a program in highschool that helped me keep pace with my homework while also allowing me to nurture my natural strengths.
						This helped me a lot, and is what enabled me to graduate highschool.
					</p>
					<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
						As the other siblings of mine moved out of the house one-by-one, my home life started to become a safer environment.
						After highschool, I took some time for introspection with the intention of healing from my burnout and trauma.
						I got a job, started saving up money, and began to build healthy habits - all of which helped me to heal.
						This is when I really started to come into my own person by transitioning and figuring out my real personality.
						After drifting through life aimlessly, I felt like an actual human being for the first time.
						Once I felt ready, I started college with my savings.
					</p>
					
					<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
						The differance between college and highschool was night and day.
						I stayed on top of my homework, got wonderful grades, and continued to grow as a person.
						Despite some difficulty towards the end of college thanks to burnout and abuse, I still ended up getting my associates degree.
						Additionally during college, I worked on myself a lot.
						I built wonderful habits, changed my mindset, became more comfortable with my gender, and lost about 70 pounds.
						With the help of therapy, I also got medicated for ADHD and depression, worked on my confidance, and drastically changed my mindset.
					</p>
					
					<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
						Taking a small break from college, I am turning the page and entering into a new stage of my life.
						My goals currently are to move out of my childhood home and fully put the years of abuse behind me.
						Afterwards, it's back to school for a bachelors degree in conservation biology or ecology.
						I know that I can achieve that and so much more.

					<p><b><u> Pets </u></b></p>
					
					<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
						While I don't like talking about myself very much, I love talking about my pets!
						I have had a few pets over the years, all of whom I am loved dearly.
					</p>
					<div style="padding-bottom:30px;"></div>
					
					
					
					<div style="display:flex-inline; flex-grow:1;">
					
						<div style="display:block ruby">
							<p><b> Flag </b></p>
							<img src="aboutme/flag.jpeg" alt="Flag peaking out of his home" style="width:210px; height:280px; float:left; background-color:white; margin:10px;">
						</div>
						
						<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
							Flag was the first pet that I ever owned.
							I've been surrounded by other pets my whole life, though.
							Growing up we had birds, dogs, cats, and yes even fish for a short period.
							But Flag was the first pet that I took the sole responsibility of, and I loved him.
						</p>
						<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
							I started taking care of him when I worked at an assisted living facility.
							Flags previous caretaker was a resident, who ended up passing away.
							The other staff were unfortunately very indifferant towards him, and so I was one of the only people who actually fed him.
							After a short period of this, I was allowed to take him home to be under my care exclusively.
						</p>
						<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
							He was reletively docile for a beta fish.
							However he would frequently flare his gills at me, nip at the snails he had in his tank, and even blew a few bubble nests.
							He was healthy and happy for a long time with me.
							I would talk to him about all my problems - he was a great listener.
						</p>
						<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
							I was away for a week watching my sisters animals when he contracted dropsy.
							When I got back I immediately noticed the pineconing scales.
							I tried everything that I could to cure him, but when the pineconing starts the prognosis is grim.
							His condition worsened and he stopped accepting food, so I was forced to put him down.
						</p>
						<div style="padding-bottom:30px;"></div>

							<img src="aboutme/princess.jpeg" alt="Princess on a houseplant" style="width:210px; height:280px; float:right; background-color:white; margin:10px;">
						</div>
						
						<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
							Princess is a little shithead towards me and I love her.
							I got Princess at the assisted living facility I worked at, similarly to Flag.
							The resident who took care of Princess had dimensia, which rapidly worsened.
							The staff worried about Princess, and so they gave her to me - since they knew I loved animals.
						</p>
						<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
							I take great care of Princess.
							She's allowed out of her cage 24/7 and can freely roam my apartment if she pleases.
							I was incredbily patient when it came to taming her and finger training her.
							Birds will only be tamed at their own pace, and she really did not trust me at first.
							I spent hours getting her to trust me, and it was all worth it.
							Now, she wont leave me alone.
						</p>
						<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
							She's really opened up to me over the years.
							She will come out of her cage to great me whenever I'm near her cage, she will land and perch on my head whenever she wants to be next to me, and she will chirp to get the attention of people on Discord.
							Princess absolutely loves attention, and she knows how to get it.
							Sometimes, she'll knock things over in my room just to cause chaos and get my attention.
							Most recently, she knocked over her water bowl all over my desk, which was <i>fun</i>.
							She also used to wake me up by landing on me and biting the fuck out of my ears.
							Despite her sassyness, I still love her.
						</p>
						<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
							Princess is still alive to this day as well. I have no idea how old she is, but she must have been young when I got her.

						</div>
						
						<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
							This is Milo. Milo was the most recent beta fish that I've owned.
							He was a rescue from one of my friends who had unfortunately neglected him.
						</p>
						<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
							He was by far the fiestiest fish I had ever seen.
							I started taking care of him while he was on death's door.
							It was very likely he wasn't going to live though another day in that friends care.
							As soon as I adopted him and acclimated him to his new home, he perked up almost immediately.
							He had a ravonous apetite, was incredibly aggressive, and would even jump out of the water to nip at me.
							All of these are great signs for a beta fish, as they've been selectively bred to be extremely aggressive.
						</p>
						<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
							Unfortunately, however, he contracted dropsy only a few weeks after I started taking care of him.
							It's very likely his past neglect weakened his immune system too much, making him suceptable to disease.
							I did everything in my power that I could, but he ended up passing away.
							I gave him the best few weeks of his life, however, and I am very proud of that.

							Meet Rainbow, he's a very shy cockatiel that I just recently started taking care of.
							He's been part of the family for years now, and successfully raised many clutches of eggs into adult cockatiels.
							Reletively recently, his partner passed away after getting egg bound.
							Rainbow took on the mantle of their sole caretaker and raised them into adulthood anyway.
							My mother came down with bird fancier's lung though, and had serious complications that forced us to get rid of most of our cockatiels.
							She wanted to keep Rainbow in the family, however.
							I thought he looked rather lonely, and my mom couldn't take care of him anyway, so I ended up adopting him.
						</p>
						<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
							He is very old for a bird at this point, and so has a lot of deeply engrained habits.
							As such, it's taking me a very long time to tame him.
							Rainbow is still very shy towards me, but he's starting to warm up to me.
							He's great friends with Princess as well, and they seem to mostly get along.

						Jaiden Barnes lived through a traumatic childhood.
						Almost all forms of abuse were present, culminating in their parents getting divorced when they were young.
						This had an obvious impact on their grades in school, that gradually got worse over time as school became more demanding.
						Grades, however, are a poor indicatator of what Jaiden's capabilities are.
						They would listen intently and absorb information from school, as well as self-teach themselves various advanced skills at a young age.
						Homework drove their grades down, due to not having a safe environment to do it in.

						Jaiden Barnes lived through a traumatic childhood.
						Almost all forms of abuse were present, culminating in their parents getting divorced when they were young.
						This had an obvious impact on their grades in school, that gradually got worse over time as school became more demanding.
						Grades, however, are a poor indicatator of what Jaiden's capabilities are.
						They would listen intently and absorb information from school, as well as self-teach themselves various advanced skills at a young age.
						Homework drove their grades down, due to not having a safe environment to do it in.
					</p>
					
					<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
						In middle and high school, stress from their home life and school had caught up to them.
						Jaiden sunk into a deep depression for over a decade as they burnt out.
						This was a period of isolation and introspection for them.
						It was a nessesary step in their life, as they had learned much about themself during this time.
						Jaiden still learned from school and self taught themself, learning was always helpful for them.
						After high school, Jaiden decided to take some time to recover from their burnout.
					</p>
					
					<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
						A few years later, Jaiden returned to school, deciding to further their education with college.
						Things were better this time around, as their home life had become more safe.
						Jaiden has been excelling in their classes, and continues to do so to this day.
						They want to help others and help the environment by becoming a conservationalist.
					</p>
					
					<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
						Jaiden Barnes has been passionately self-teaching themselves new concepts since they were young.
						The first subject they pursued was astronomy; studying the cosmos has always appealed to them.
						From elementary school to middle school, they learned a disproportionate amount of information on astronomy, covering everything from orbital mechanics and the life cycle of stars to nitty-gritty details about all the planets in our solar system.
						This hyperfixation lasted years and helped them take their mind off their traumatic home life.
						As they grew up, they branched out to other subjects such as biology, physics, chemistry, anthropology, geology, and computer science.
						They have always, and will always, love to learn.
					</p>
					
					<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
						In middle and high school, however, the stress from their home life had caught up to them.
						They completely shut down for almost a decade, sinking into a deep depression.
						This was a period of isolation and introspection for Jaiden; it was a dark but necessary step in their life.
						Instead of learning about the outside world, Jaiden took this time to learn about themself instead.
						Interestingly, we can see a shift in their interests as well; instead of studying material sciences, they began to study psychology, philosophy, and sociology.
						Coming out of this cocoon-esque period of their life, they were reborn into a new person entirely.
						They still have a long way to go before they can be happy again, but they're making steps in the right direction.
					</p>
					
					<p><b><u> Formal Education </u></b></p>
					
					<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
						Jaiden started their formal education at Sauk Prairie High School.
						There, they barely scraped by, thanks to the aforementioned depression and burnout.
						However, they still managed to pass their classes.
						Indeed, Jaiden isn't proud of how they navigated this part of their life, but what's done is done.
						Interestingly, while they didn't excel in their classes, they were still self-teaching themselves all sorts of things.
						Most notably among the things they learned was programming.
						They learned how to program in Javascript sometime in late middle school to early high school.
						Using these skills, they created games they could share with their friends, such as the viral sensation <i>Platformer</i> and cult classic <i>Zombie Survival</i>.
						These games spread around the school district and became quite popular among their classmates.
						After graduating, I believe these games were blocked, but it's fascinating to think that the weird, quiet kid became semi-popular as "the person who made that platformer game."
					</p>
					<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
						After a few years of recovering from burnout, Jaiden decided to continue their education in college.
						They aspire to earn a biology degree and are considering pursuing multiple degrees in the future.
						Jaiden is nothing if not indecisive, so they'll pursue <i>all</i> their interests instead of picking just one.
						They got into the University of Wisconsin-Platteville, where they're currently working toward an associate's degree.
						They've only completed their freshman year so far but passed with flying colors, earning A's in almost all their classes and getting named on the Dean's List.
						They're hoping to continue this momentum into their sophomore year.
