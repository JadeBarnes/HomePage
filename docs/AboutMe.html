						Michael Barnes has been passionately self teaching himself since he was just a young lad. 
						At first, mostly just about space and astronomy, as he had always found the subjects fascinating.
						Another thing that fascinated him was video games and computing. Ever since he was little, he always
						wanted to create a game of his own. Games are a beautiful art form to him, a form which he wanted to master some day.
						When he was about 13-ish, he decided to start his game creation journey. Starting from google drive presentation games,
						with hyperlinks to get player input, he eventually went through the motions and learned how to properly program in languages like JavaScript and C#.
						Learning how to program ignited a burning passion within him to learn more about computing, about programming as a whole, not just
						for games. Most notably of these passion subjects being machine learning.
					</p>
					
					<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
						Michael received his formal education at Sauk Prairie High School, where he created
						the viral sensation <i>Platformer</i> and cult classic <i>Zombie Survival</i>. To this
						day he is still creating games and other projects like these out of passion, such as his
						upcoming RPG, <i>Bloodline</i>.
