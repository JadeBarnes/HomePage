					The Adventures of Some Guy saga first began when I was in 6th grade. I was tasked with making a game for a school project. I spent some time learning how to
					use Stencyl, a very basic game engine for beginners. I had no idea how to program, and I hardly knew what I was doing. I threw together a very basic game for
					the project. The game camera was 2D side on, and the player charecter was this guy pictured to the right. The player could move in every direction, using the up key
					to flap their arms and fly. It was an "exploration game", I made a long level and the player could explore it if they wanted to. There was no threats, and no
					insentive of progressing. The level included "scenic" areas such as a castle and a maze. Unfortunatly, all known copies have been lost to the ages as I accidently
					archived my friends game (The Adventures of Some Guy <i>you met on the street</i>) instead of my masterpiece.

					Shortly after I was done with TAOSG, I went on to make the long awaited sequal. This game was way more sophisticated than the last. The scene was set the same way,
					but now in addition to moving, the player could lob grenades with the arrow keys, and could shoot a pistol with j,k,l, and i. The player had to get to the end of
					the level without getting hit by enemies. Enemies in the first level included turrets and a tank miniboss. The second level was a robot boss that would shoot missiles 
					at the player. The third level was a mine, it'd descend down into the Earth, enemies included turrets, missile turrets, and the tanks again. The game ended after that
					because I never actually made the second boss, or any other levels. This game was very bad, and very basic, but it still holds a special place in my heart. You can
					download the flash file (.swf) below, you'll need a flash emulator to play it.

					While these games were basic, they taught me so much about game design as a whole such as art, animation, programming fundimentals, and optimisation. I'd consider
					these games to be milestones, they ignited my love for creating games, and as such they'll always hold a special place in my heart.
