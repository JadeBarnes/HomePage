					Blaster Boi is one of those games that just feels surreal to me, like it truly doesn't exist. But, as of 5/25/2021 I have recovered it and can now publish it
					and properly archive it. I made Blaster Boi out of the desire to make a game in pure C#, no pre-made game engine, nothing. I wanted to see what it was like to
					create something on a lower level. It's always been a desire of mine to forgo game engines entirely and just make what I need to myself, so I channeled those
					desires into Blaster Boi.
				</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs">
					In this game, you use w,a,s, and d to move around the screen, you can press and hold shift to sprint, and click the mouse to shoot. Shooting and sprinting will
					use up a limited pool of energy, which will recharge over time. You must defend yourself from various enemies that increase in difficulty and number as time
					goes on.
				</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs">
					Blaster Boi was a milestone for me, not only because it was pure C#, but because it was the first program I wrote competent AI for. In the game there are
					a few different kinds of enemies, Maws, Gazers, Psychics, and Big Brains, each with their own AI. <b>Maws</b> were by far the simplest, they move toward the
					player, that's it. Truly, that is the most basic "AI" can get. <b>Gazers</b> were a small step up, they'd move toward the player and shoot a small bullet
					at them periodically. <b>Psychics</b> will keep their distance from the player while shooting rapid fire bolts of energy. After a few seconds they will stop
					and fire a low-accuracy spray of particles at the player. <b>Big Brains</b> are my personal favorite, they will teleport around the screen while firing waves of energy
					toward the player, teleport to a spot and reflect nearby projectiles shot by the player for a short period, and finally they will spawn a Brainling. <b>Brainlings</b>
					will erratically move toward the player and explode into 8 bullets when killed or when they get close enough to the player.
