				<h1>Welcome!</h1>
				<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
					My name is Jaiden Barnes, I am a self driven individual who loves learning new and exiting things.
					On my free time, I'll often try to teach myself subjects that I'm interested in.
					Biology, Astronomy, Physics, and - most notably for this website - Computer Science.
					As a result of this, I have made a few neat projects over the years.
					These were created just for fun, but also acted as self-tests for me.
					This website was a self-test for me that I created in Notepad++.
					I decided to put the best of them together into an archive that would allow me to share them easily with employers and friends.

					If you want to look at the stuff I made, you can head to the Portfolio tab instead.
