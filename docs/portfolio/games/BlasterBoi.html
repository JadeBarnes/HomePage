					Blaster Boi is a game that I always forget about.
					Not because it's a bad game, but because it's a surreal achievement.
					It doesn't feel real that I created a game in about a week that was this advanced for its time.
					But I did, and as of May 25<sup style="font-size: 10px;">th</sup>, 2021, I have officially recovered it and can always remember it.
				</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs">
					This game was created in an attempt to explore programming a game in pure C#.
					Prior to this, I was using the Unity game engine.
					However, I wanted more control over the underlying systems and wanted to minimize the bloat that comes packaged with Unity.
					So I embarked on developing a game at a much lower level: Blaster Boi.
				</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs">
					In this game, you use the W, A, S, and D keys to move, and hold Shift to sprint.
					You can shoot with the left mouse button.
					Both sprinting and shooting will consume a limited pool of energy, which will recharge over time.
					Your objective is to defend yourself from various enemies, whose difficulty and numbers will increase over time.
				</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs">
					Blaster Boi was a milestone in multiple ways.
					Not only was it the first game I created in C#, it was also the first program I wrote proper AI for.
					You could argue there's some form of AI in <a href="ZombieSurvival.html">Zombie Survival</a>, but the intelligence in this is more diverse and intelligent.
					There are a few types of enemies: Maws, Gazers, Psychics, Big Brains, and their minions, Brainlings.
				</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs" style="text-indent:0px;">
					<img alt="Picture of a Maw enemy" src="blasterBoi/Enemy_Maw.png" style="width:32px;height:32px;float:left;margin-right:5px;">
					Maws are the simplest and first to be implemented. They walk towards the player in a straight line.
					They serve as fodder enemies and can easily be ignored.
				</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs enemy" style="text-indent:0px;">
					<img alt="Picture of a Gazer" src="blasterBoi/Enemy_Gazer.png" style="width:32px;height:32px;float:left;margin-right:5px;">
					Gazers are a slight step up.
					They will chase the player and periodically shoot bullets.
					While still considered fodder enemies, they pose a greater threat and can't be ignored as easily.
				</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs" style="text-indent:0px;">
					<img alt="Picture of a Psychic enemy" src="blasterBoi/Enemy_Psychic.png" style="width:32px;height:32px;float:left;margin-right:5px;">
					Psychics are intimidating when you first encounter them.
					They maintain their distance from the player while rapidly shooting bolts of energy at them.
					Eventually, they stop and unleash a low-accuracy spray of energy, which can easily kill the player if caught in it.
				</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs" style="text-indent:0px;">
					<img alt="Picture of a Big Brain enemy" src="blasterBoi/Enemy_BB.png" style="width:32px;height:32px;float:left;margin-right:5px;">
					Big Brains are my favorite; they're more of a boss-type enemy.
					Their AI is broken up into states.
					In their initial state, they teleport around the screen and unleash waves of energy towards the player.
					After a few teleports, they transition into a second state where they reflect incoming projectiles within a large radius.
					Once they finish, their final state is to spawn a few Brainlings and enter an idle phase, allowing the player a chance to deal with them.
					Finally, the state machine resets to the initial state.
				</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs" style="text-indent:0px;">
					<img alt="Picture of a Brainling enemy" src="blasterBoi/Enemy_Brainling.png" style="width:16px;height:16px;float:left;margin-right:5px;">
					Brainlings are simple enemies; they're small and fast, darting erratically to chase the player.
					They explode into bullets either upon getting close to the player or when killed.
				</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs">
					You can tell that I had a lot of fun designing the AI for this game, particularly the diverse moveset of the Big Brains.
					Smart AI has always fascinated me.
					Watching AI adapt to new information and react accordingly is immensely intriguing and can greatly enhance a game for me.
					While this game isn't immersive and the AI can't respond to new information, it was my attempt at experimenting with new ideas and implementing AI that I found enjoyable.

					Blaster Boi is one of those games that just feels surreal to me, like it truly doesn't exist. But, as of 5/25/2021 I have recovered it and can now publish it
					and properly archive it. I made Blaster Boi out of the desire to make a game in pure C#, no pre-made game engine, nothing. I wanted to see what it was like to
					create something on a lower level. It's always been a desire of mine to forgo game engines entirely and just make what I need to myself, so I channeled those
					desires into Blaster Boi.

					goes on.

					Blaster Boi was a milestone for me, not only because it was pure C#, but because it was the first program I wrote proper AI for. In the game there are
					a few different kinds of enemies, Maws, Gazers, Psychics, Big Brains, and their minions - brainlings. <b>Maws</b> were by far the simplest, they move toward the
					player, that's it. <b>Gazers</b> were a small step up, they'd move toward the player and shoot a small bullet
					at them periodically. <b>Psychics</b> will keep their distance from the player while shooting rapid fire bolts of energy. After a few seconds they will stop
					and fire a low-accuracy spray of particles at the player. <b>Big Brains</b> are my personal favorite. They are a boss-like mob that will teleport around the screen while firing waves of energy
					toward the player, teleport to a spot and reflect nearby projectiles shot by the player for a short period, and finally they will spawn a Brainling. <b>Brainlings</b>
					will erratically move toward the player and explode into 8 bullets when killed or when they get close enough to the player.
				</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs">
					As you can tell, I really liked working on this game. Working with the AI for this game was a pleasure, I've always been
					fascinated by how the AI in games function. This game really solidified those feelings.
