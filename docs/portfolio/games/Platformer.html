				This is a very simple platformer I made in high school.
				Use the arrow keys to navigate the scene, avoiding the red squares while trying to reach the blue square.
				Moving into a red square will kill your character and respawn you at the start of the level.
				You'll lose a life when you die, shown at the top of the screen.
				If you lose all your lives, the entire game restarts.
				There are 8 levels in total, none of which are designed to be fair.
				Good luck!

				As mentioned, I first made this game in my sophomore year of high school.
				I was inspired to create a physics-based game after taking a physics class.
				I wrote the physics engine over a few weeks during downtime in classes and built a game on top of it afterward.
				The game was designed to be incredibly difficult and downright unfair at times.
				It was primarily an exercise in developing my game design skills and secondarily a game meant to be played.
			</p>
			
			<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
				From a game design perspective, the difficulty ended up being somewhat of a boon for the game in the end.
				The games typically played in school during downtime were often idle games or grindfests that you would slowly chip away at.
				These games tended to numb the mind of those playing, delivering doses of dopamine after an achievement, which was suited for the school environment.
				This game was perfectly fit for school then.
				It presented a Sisyphean task: an uphill battle against evil level design and unfair game mechanics.
				Players would expend countless lives on a single level, receive a hit of dopamine upon completion, only to barely glimpse the next level before being sent back to square one.
				The levels were mind-numbing, but the enticement of progressing to the next one drove players forward.
				The prospect of reaching the end and conquering it kept players hooked.
				There was, indeed, an end to it all, but I doubt anyone ever actually reached it due to the game's difficulty.

				This was the first high-quality game I ever made and one of my first major projects in JavaScript.
				I shared the game with a few close friends, who then passed it on to others.
				The game quickly spread throughout the school, and over the next few years, the entire school system was playing it.
				I was approached several times by random people who wanted to meet "the person who made that platformer game."
				They would express their frustrations (it's a <i>very</i> hard game) and suggest improvements.
				This popularity was surreal to me, as I've always been a loner.
				However, it brought me great joy to see people I didn't know playing my game in classes.
				I did my best to balance it, fix bugs and exploits, and polish it for these people.
				Eventually, though, I moved on to other projects, and the school ended up blocking access to the game.
			</p>
			
			<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">
				I believe this game is what truly sparked my passion for game development.
				Even years later, it still brings me joy to know that I created something others enjoyed playing.
				I've always wanted to make games since I was a child.
				However, witnessing this game come to fruition and gain popularity relatively quickly really highlights what I'm capable of.
				In fact, it highlights what anyone is capable of; games are art, and no one is barred from creating art.
				Even a weird loner like me.

				In this simple platformer, use the arrow keys to move the red player around the scene,
				you can wall jump by holding up and moving into the side of a wall. Your goal is to try and get to the blue exit and avoid the red hazards to pass onto the next level.
				moving into a hazard will kill your charactor, you'll respawn at the start of the level and loose a life. Once
				all 200 lives (seen at the top of the screen) are depleted, you will restart the whole game.
				There are 8 levels in total, good luck!

				I first made this game as a sophomore in high school after getting inspired by physics class to make a physics based game.
				I wrote it in a few weeks using JavaScript. It was my first quality JS game, and as such, it quickly caught on. In school we had these chromebooks, after I sent it
				to a few friends they then sent it to their friends, and so on and so forth. Over the next few years the whole school system
				was enjoying this platformer game. So much so, that the site that I hosted it on was blocked by the school. Still though, this resounding, and unexpected success
				led to me making more JS games and other projects, eventually making a scuffed website to act as a linking page between them. The most notable of these games being my
				Zombie Survival game.
