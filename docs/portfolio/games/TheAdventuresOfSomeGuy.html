					My first real game I made, beyond those I created in Google Slides, was created in 6th grade.
					I was tasked with making a game for a school project, so I created "The Adventures of Some Guy."
					It was a very basic 2 dimensional "exploration game," where the player would navigate from the left of the level to the right.
					It was a side-on, similar to Mario, and players could move along the ground and fly upwards indefinitely.
					The camera would follow the player, revealing scenic landscapes such as a field, a castle, and a maze.
					Whatever you're imagining, it's worse.
					There were no threats and no incentive to progress, so it can hardly be called a game.
					Nonetheless, it was my first time dipping my feet into game development.
					It was created using the incredibly bare-bones Stencyl engine.
					I had no idea how to program, and had no idea what I was doing in general.
					I had a great time though, and managed to create a very basic game to get an A on the project.
					Unfortunately, however, all known copies have been lost to the ages.

					The Adventures of Some Guy saga first began when I was in 6th grade.
					I was tasked with making a game for a school project.
					I spent some time learning how to use Stencyl, a very basic game engine for beginners.
					I had no idea how to program, and I hardly knew what I was doing.
					I threw together a very basic game for the project.
					The game camera was 2D side on, and the player character was this guy pictured to the right.
					The player could move in every direction, using the up key to flap their arms and fly.
					It was an "exploration game", I made a long level and the player could explore it if they wanted to.
					There was no threats, and no incentive of progressing.
					The level included "scenic" areas such as a castle and a maze.
					Unfortunately, all known copies have been lost to the ages.

					Shortly after the previous masterpiece, I began work on a sequel, a vastly more sophisticated and ambitious game.
					The player could now lob grenades and shoot a pistol to fight off enemies such as automated turrets and robots.
					It featured a death state, where if the player got injured they'd be sent back to the start of the level.
					It also boasted a whole two and a half levels.
					The first level is a factory, the player would climb their way to the top floor, destroying turrets, and fight a tank mini-boss at the top.
					After flying out the chimney, they could progress to the second level.
					The second level was a boss battle, where you would have to fight a mech.
					The mech would shoot missiles at the player, you had to dodge these and throw grenades at it to damage it.
					After it's first phase, the head would start flying around, shooting missiles downwards at you.
					You again had to dodge the missiles, but this time you had to damage it with your pistol.
					After defeating it you would move on.
					The third level was a mine shaft, you had to avoid or destroy more tanks and turrets before reaching the bottom and moving on.
					The fourth level was supposed to be a boss but it never got implemented as I abandoned the project.
					I began to reach the limits of what the Stencyl engine could do; the performance was terrible and the physics were janky.
					This game was bad, but it helped me learn about the basic principals of game design.
					It will always hold a special place in my heart as being my first real game.

					Shortly after I was done with TAOSG, I went on to make the sequel. This game was way more sophisticated than the last. The scene was set the same way,
					but now in addition to moving, the player could lob grenades with the arrow keys, and could shoot a pistol with j, k, l, and i. The player had to get to the end of
					the level without getting hit by enemies. Enemies in the first level included turrets and a tank miniboss. The second level was a robot boss that would shoot missiles
					at the player. The third level was a mine, it'd descend down into the Earth, enemies included turrets, missile turrets, and the tanks again. The game ended after that
					because I never actually made the second boss, or any other levels. This game was very bad (especially when it came to performance), and very basic. 
					But it still holds a special place in my heart.
					You can	download the flash file (.swf) below, you'll need a flash emulator to play it.

					While these games were basic, they taught me so much about game design as a whole such as art, animation, programming fundamentals, and optimization.
					They wetted my feet for game design and ignited a deep passion whithin me for creation.

					You can download The Adventures of Some Guy II below. 
					It's compiled in Flash, so you'll need a flash player to play it.
					My personal flash player of choice is the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.newgrounds.com/flash/player">Newgrounds Flash Player</a>, if you don't already have one.
					Finally, while it looks like their music is entirely free, but the game doesn't have any credits to actually credit them.
					So this game uses music from the Soundcloud artist <a target="_blank"  href="https://soundcloud.com/vonikk">Vonikk</a>.
					
					<!--I'd consider
					these games to be huge milestones, they ignited my love for creating games, and as such they'll always hold a special place in my heart.-->
