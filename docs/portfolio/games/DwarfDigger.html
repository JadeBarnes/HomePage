				Dwarf Digger is a little mining and craft-em-up game that I made for my AP Computer Science final exam. To play this game use the w, a, s, and d keys
				to explore around the map. You can click on tiles to mine them, and right click with them selected to place them. To select tiles from your inventory (top-left), use
				the scroll wheel until it's highlighted. Pressing and holding E will open the crafting menu, you can scroll through the recipes and craft them by clicking on them. You
				will need the materials, and will also sometimes need to be next to a crafting station (like a furnace). After crafting a new pickaxe or other piece of equipment, select it
				and press F to equip it. You can also drop (delete) something by selecting it and pressing X.

				This is by far the most advanced game that I created in highschool. It has a scalable world that can stretch into all directions as long as you want it too. It does this
				by breaking the world into chunks, so that only certain sections of the world have to be considered in calculations and rendering. That is one of the many hoops I had to jump
				through to get a game like this to run smoothly with the limited proccessing power of a chromebook.

				Dwarf Digger has many refined features such as collision physics, mining, crafting, inventory, UI, and many other possibilities with the game engine I built for this.
				It was very overkill for the project, and indeed took a lot to cram development into a 2 week window. After the project was complete and submitted, I worked on this a bit more just for fun.
				Adding in crafting stations, and refining some mechanics. Even as of 1-4-2023, I decided to add an additional, final content pack to the game. Adding multiuple items,
				tweaking world generation, and adding the anvil. Even this far down the line, I still have ideas, and still care about this game.

				Close this window and give it a try yourself, see how deep you can go. Note that some blocks can only be destroyed with a stronger pickaxe.
