				<h1>Cellular Automata</h1>
				<p class="generalParagraphs">
					Cellular Automata is the process of using a grid of cells with simple rules to create complex patterns. In the game of life, the
					world is made up of a grid of cells, these cells can either be alive (black) or dead (white).
				</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs">
					<img src="cells/cells1.png" style="width:60px;height:60px;float:left;">
					In this example to the left, the top-left, center, and bottom-left cells are alive. Every other cell is dead.
				</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs">
					Now, let's step the simulation forward. We loop over every cell, every cell checks it's 8 neighbors and counts how many are alive.
					If a cell has less than two neighbors, it dies from loneliness. If the cell has 2 or 3 neighbors, it lives to the next generation.
					If a cell has 4 or more neighbors, it dies from overpopulation. But, we also loop over the dead cells, in conways weird world,
					if a dead cell has exactly 3 alive neighbors, the cell turns alive as they reproduce. <b>Note that all the changes are applied at the
					same time.</b> We can boil this down to some simple rules:
				</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs">-If an alive cell has less than 2, or more than 3 living neighbors, it dies.</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs">-If an alive cell has 2 or 3 living neighbors it stays to the next generation.</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs">-If a dead cell has exactly 3 living neighbors, it turns into an alive cell.</p>
				<p class="generalParagraphs">
					We can write this in an easy to read format that is used to quickly convey the rules of other automata: B3/S23. The B3 stands for "Begin 3",
					if a dead cell has 3 neighbors, it begins it's life, it is born. The S23 stands for "Stay 2 or 3", if an alive cell has 2 or 3 neighbors, it
					stays to the next generation.
				</p>
				
				
				<p class="generalParagraphs">
					
					Continuing with our example, let's step it forward. First we loop through every cell and count their neighbors. The top-left and bottom-left 
					cells would die from loneliness in the next generation. The center cell would stay because it has 2 neighbors. The left-center cell would begin
					it's life because it has 3 neighbors.
				</p>
				<div>
					<img src="cells/cells1.png" style="width:60px;height:60px;margin:2px;">
					<img src="cells/cells2.png" style="width:60px;height:60px;margin:2px;">
					<img src="cells/cells3.png" style="width:60px;height:60px;margin:2px;">
				</div>
				<p class="generalParagraphs">
					<img src="cells/cells3.png" style="width:60px;height:60px;float:left;">
					This would be the next state of our example, and unfortunately the last step too. If we step this simulation forward the remaining 2 cells would
					die from loneliness, leaving no living cells :(

				<h2>Game of Life (B3/S23)</h2>
				<p class="generalParagraphs">
					This rule is explained in detail above. This truly is a classic example of cellular automata, it forms interesting, life-like patterns. It forms
					colonies, gliders, hives, and, if you set the right starting states, people have built fully functional computers and logic components with this rule.
				</p>
				
				
				
				<h2>Caves (B5678/S45678)</h2>
				<img src="cells/cells_caves.png" style="width:300px;height:200px;margin:2px;">
				<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:5px">
					This automata has a scarier looking name than the simple B2/S23, but it's still a simple rule! If an alive cell has 4 or more neighbors it stays,
					and if a dead cell has 5 or more neighbors it begins. Using this automata results in cave-like patterns if we imagine alive cells as walls and
					dead cells as the floor. The example above was initialized as noise, every pixel had a random starting state. After a few generation the cells 
					settled into an equilibrium state, where no cells are created or destroyed every step. If you use this in a game, you can easily generate cavernous
					areas for the player to explore around.
				</p>
				<p  style="padding-bottom:5px">Just note, if you install this rule using the link below you have to click to step forward the simulation, it's not broken I swear.</p>
				
				
				
				<h2>Amoeba (B357/S1358)</h2>
				<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:5px">
					This is definitely my favorite kind of cellular automata. I don't know why, but when I first saw it in a program called "The Powder Toy" I just fell in love with it.
					With the Amoeba rule, cells will form chaotic patterns that resemble amoeba with how they move. An interesting thing about this rule that I only read about
					shortly before writing this, is that the patterns it forms will slowly grow if they're above a certain size, ~100 x 100. Below that and they will slowly shrink.
				</p>
				<img src="cells/tringle.png" style="width:275px;height:275px;margin:0px;">
				<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:5px">
					After playing around with this automata, I noticed something peculiar. Creating a straight line of alive cells with this rule will result in a sierpinski's triangle
					pattern. Another reason why this automata is amazing. I've included a program that simulates this in the package as well.
