			Solar System Model
		</h1>
		<p class="generalParagraphs">
			This is a very simple model of our solar system.
			I created this back in highschool because I wanted to experiment with a polar coordinate system instead of the classic cartesian system.
		</p>
		<h2>
			The Model Itself
		</h2>
		<p class="generalParagraphs">
			The model does not accurately depict size, distance, speed, color... or really anything to be honest.
			Again, it was created to test polar coordinates, not be an accurate model.
			Reguardless, it does show every planet in the solar system very clearly, as well as the sun at the origin of the coordinate system.
			If you look closer, you can see other details as well, such as moons.
			Only some moons are pictured: Our moon, Phobos and Deimos, and the Galilean moons.
			Saturn has "rings," which in this model is just a bunch of moons orbiting the planet to emulate a ring effect.
			Finally, if you squint, you can make out asteroids.
			There's the Asteroid Belt which is between Mars and Jupiter, the Kuiper belt which is beyond Neptune, and the Trojon Asteroids resting 60° in front of and behind Jupiter, in it's Lagrange points.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Polar vs Cartesian Coordinates
		</h2>
		<p class="generalParagraphs">
			The Cartesian Coordinate System is the system that everyone is familiar with.
			In a 2D context, it utilizes an X axis and a Y axis to emulate space.
			An object in cartesian space has it's left-right position represented with it's X axis, and it's up-down position represented with Y.
			For example, the Sun is at <span class="coordinatesCartesianFor0"></span>, this is the center of the screen, the origin is in the top left corner.
			Jupiter is at <span class="coordinatesCartesianFor5"></span>.
		</p>
		<p class="generalParagraphs">
			The Polar Coordinate System is more niche, but is excellent for applications like this.
			Instead of X and Y, it uses r and φ (Phi).
			"r" is for "Radius," it represents an objects distance from a referance point - typically the origin.
			"φ" is for "Angle," it represents the angle in degrees at which it's offset.
			An angle of 0° would be to the right of the origin, and an angle of 270° would be above the origin.
			For example, the sun is at (0, 0) it's distance from the origin is 0 as it's placed on top of it.
			This also means that it's angle doesn't matter, since it wont move even if it changes.
			Jupiter is at <span class="coordinatesFor5"></span>, it's distance is at 100 and will never change, this is it's distance from the sun.
			The only thing that's changing is it's angle, because it's moving along it's orbit.
		</p>
		<p class="generalParagraphs">
			There are pros and cons to each method, but they both accomplish the same goal.
			The biggest pro to using polar coordinates is just how easy it is to achieve rotation.
			With cartesian coordinates, to find the x and y values you need to use Sine and Cosine functions to plot where it would be given the angle.
			However, all you need to do for polar coordinates is to increase or decrease φ.
			<i>That</i> is why it's perfect for applications like this.
		</p>
		<p class="generalParagraphs">
			And finally, just for fun here's a comparison of the coordinates of all the planets.
			In my oppinion, the polar coordinates are easier to read; You can quickly glean how far out it is and how far along it's orbit it is.
