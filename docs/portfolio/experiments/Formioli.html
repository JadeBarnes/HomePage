						I was making a game a while back that I ended up abandoning.
						Before I did though, I was working on the GUI and decided that I wanted to make my own font to fit with the style of the game.
						This approach would also allow me to bake in unique symbols that were used in the game world.
						I'll almost certainly come back to that game concept at some point in the future since it's been on my mind ever since.
					</p>
					<p class="generalParagraphs formiolli">
						There are two font families that I made that were designed to be used in differant parts of the game.
						"Formiolli Medium" is what you're reading right now.
						This was supposed to be used for larger GUI elements and books that could be found and read in-game.
						It's supposed to look slightly hand-written, since it's designed for scripts in a Tolkien-esque fantasy game.
					</p>
					<p class="generalParagraphs formiolliSmall" style="font-size:32px;">
						"Formiolli Small" is designed to be used for small GUI elements, such as damage numbers when you strike an enemy.
						Because of this, it has special symbols associated with it to represent damage types in the game.
						For example @ represents fire damage and ¬ represents acid damage.
						What you see here is scaled up to double it's normal size, since the in-game camera was zoomed in more than most monitors.
						You can see what it would look like in it's unaltered state below in the examples.
					</p>
					<p class="generalParagraphs formiolli">
						While these aren't the most practical fonts for uses outside the game, you can still pick them up if you'd like!
						You can download them below, there's no restriction on their usage.
