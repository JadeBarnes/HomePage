						I have been making Minecraft modpacks for years now.
						When I feel the itch to return to this game, I lovingly assemble a modpack for me, my friends, and my family.
						I love to host servers for everyone that's interested, and it's always a really fun time.
						My first two servers lived for about a month each before people (including myself) lost interest in them.
						The death of a server is more than okay with me, because I've found that I tend to enjoy making modpacks more than playing them most of the time.
						It really satisfies my need for creativity and self-expression, and there's something special about making something that others will enjoy too.
					</p>
					<p class="generalParagraphs">
						That being said though, there's nothing more satisfying to me than seeing what other people create during the life of a server.
						The longer a server lives, the more stuff people will create on it.
						A server dies pretty quickly when players feel like there's "nothing left to do."
						Players need to feel like they're working towards something greater to stay interested.
						I had an idea to modify Minecraft's weird progression curve to keep people interested, but first I needed to create a test mod to see what it was like to mod Minecraft in the first place.
					</p>
					
					<p class="generalParagraphs">
						I wanted to make a simple mod that adds in a few items.
						What should I add?
						I don't know, Klarbrunn I guess.
						It's this sparkling water that I really like, and it was good enough for a test mod like this.
						I dusted off my Java knowledge and got to work with learning how to interface with Minecraft, the Forge modloader, and other mods.
						Within a week I had made my first Minecraft mod, and had added in every single flavor of Klarbrunn.
						Using mixers from the Create mod, you can mix together various flavors of Klarbrunn using fruits and coal (coal is for the carbonation, obviously).
					</p>
					<p class="generalParagraphs">
						This was my first venture into Minecraft modding, which is why such a small mod is getting archived here.
						It was a lot of fun to make though and I'm very happy with how it turned out, even if no one ever crafted any Klarbrunn on the server :).
						After making this, I got to work on my <a href="Science.html">Science mod</a> to extend Minecraft's progression.
