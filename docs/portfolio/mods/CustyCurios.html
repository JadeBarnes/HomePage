						Custy Curios is a mod that I have poured my heart and soul into, and it shows.
						In my Minecraft servers, something that players have always loved are "curios" - rings, amulets, and other wearable baubles.
						However, I found that every mod I came across that added these sucked.
						They were way too strong to the point of nullifying other systems in the server entirely.
						So I took matters into my own hands and created a mod that adds in more balanced curios.

						Every curio has a unique effect that it gives the player until it breaks.
						Even though they break, curios are scattered so frequently across the world that they can be used very liberally.
						Players can wear one necklace and two rings, this allows them to mix and match effects as they please.
						Additionally, if a player wears two of the same ring it will "overcharge," increasing the potency of it's effect at the cost of durability.
						There are plenty of secret interactions for players to discover as well, and some curios can transform into new ones under the right conditions.
