						Minecraft is a very wonderful game, but I have always had an issue with the progression system.
						You start out by making a single wooden pickaxe, then you mine exactly three blocks of stone for a stone pick.
						If you find a surface cave, you might end up with iron tools in less than 10 minutes.
						A full set of iron armor can be created after just one trip to into the mines, afterwards you're invincible to most threats in the overworld.
						If you're skilled enough with shields you don't even really need diamonds since you can block almost anything with no repercussions.
						It's just a matter of time before you find diamonds and start enchanting items, afterwards you can just face-tank anything.
						Netherite simply isn't very necessary for a PvE server outside of the bonus durability, so not a lot of players feel the need to mine for it.
						It doesn't help that it has to be mined in the most tedious way possible - thanks Microsoft.
						To sum up Minecraft's progression: for 10 minutes you're going through the motions to get iron afterwards there is nothing that can harm you.
					</p>
					<p class="generalParagraphs">
						This progression really sucks, since the early game feels like going down a samey checklist before you can really play the game.
						However, the mid game where you have iron tools and unenchanted armor is genuinely a lot of fun.
						During this stage, mobs can still hurt you and clearing out caves can still be exciting.
						The thrill of being vulnerable only lasts so long though, after a certain point venturing to previously dangerous places become a chore more than anything.
					</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom:10px;">
						Modding Minecraft can only fix these issues so much if the vanilla progression is left intact:
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>New tools and armor tend to never get used.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Players will often stick to what they know unless they're <i>pushed</i> to experiment.
								Simply adding in side-grades to iron or diamonds will not change anything, since players will just ignore them.
							</li>
							<li>Adding in end-game weapons and armor is useless for a PvE server in the same way that Netherite is.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<li>Adding in additional threats can keep the feeling of vulnerability around longer.</li>
						<ul>
							<li>However most modded threats tend to feel cheap since Minecraft's combat simply isn't designed to accommodate larger threats.</li>
							<li>This approach also can alienate players who aren't very skilled with combat.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					
					<p class="generalParagraphs">
						With this in mind, I had an idea to extend Minecraft's progression by balancing new and existing tools around a research system.
						Players would use a mod in the modpack that gave them objectives or quests to complete.
						After these objectives were completed, they would be given an "insight" item.
						Players have to take this insight and research it by mass-producing special "research" items.
						After the insight is fully researched, it can be repeatedly used inside the normal crafting recipes to craft items.
					</p>
					
					
					<p class="generalParagraphs">
						Using this system, I sorted weapons, tools, and armor into tiers: stone, iron, diamond, and netherite.
						Each tier included modded side-grades, most of which were slightly stronger than it's vanilla equivalent in order to encourage players to experiment.
						I locked each tier behind insights and created a tech-tree using the quest system.
						This meant that players were forced to experiment around with lower-tier items more while they went on quests to unlock higher tiers.
						You could no longer rush iron in less than 10 minutes, as questing and research took a few hours.
						This meant that the excitement of vulnerability lasted much, much longer.
						Higher tier items felt incredibly rewarding to get your mitts on as well, and helped keep players engaged while they worked for them.
					</p>
					<p class="generalParagraphs">
						I also locked a lot of other items behind intermediate researches.
						This included automation related blocks and machines, magical items, and more.
						This gave a more natural feel to modded Minecraft's automation mods.
						ComputerCraft for example is an extremely powerful mod and computers are super cheap to build.
						It wouldn't feel right if the player could construct a nuclear reactor but still didn't know how to work iron yet.
					</p>
					
					<p class="generalParagraphs">
						Overall, the progression system was received fairly well overall.
						The hardened Minecraft veterans were a fan of it since it made the game more challenging and made previously useless items useful.
						The casual players made a bit of a fuss about it, but since I made most essential items extremely cheap to research their complaints were short lived.
						Despite thier fussiness, they did genuinely enjoy smoothing out the progression curve and loved the satisfaction of getting what they needed.
						One aspect that I loved as well was that it helped bring the server together.
						Since researched insights were simply items, they could be shared by players.
						Also since the research lab required an amethyst, there was a huge server-wide search for amethyst which players cooperated on.
						This also successfully extended the life of the server as well!
					</p>
					<p class="generalParagraphs">
						However, this system was not without it's flaws.
						There was a problem with exploitation.
						When a game pushes players in one direction, players will naturally push back.
						This is typically a good thing since it engages players.
						However, if they push against each other hard enough, something breaks.
						A few players managed to find ways to bypass the locks I created and get around the research system.
						I'm only human, and when you're managing 100+ mods with an unholy amount of recipes and interactions to take into account you're bound to miss something.
						However, the players in question would also intentionally not report my mistakes so they could continue to exploit the game before I patched it.
						It was incredibly frustrating, and so I needed to create a more robust system to manage locks in the future.
