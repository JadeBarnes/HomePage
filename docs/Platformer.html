					<h1>Platformer</h1>
					<p class="generalParagraphs" style="padding-bottom:10px;">In this simple platformer, you move using the w,a,s, and d keys to move the red player around the scene,
					you can walljump by holding up and moving into the side of a wall. Your goal is to try and get to the blue exit and avoid the red hazards to pass onto the next level.
					There are 8 levels in total, good luck! </p>
					
					<p class="generalParagraphs"> I first made this game as a sophomore in high school after getting inspired by physics class to make a physics based game.
					I wrote it in a few weeks using JavaScript. It was my first quality JS game, and as such, it quickly caught on. In school we had these chromebooks, which is
					what I made it on, after I sent it to a few friends they then sent it to their friends, and so on and so forth. Over the next few years the whole school system
					was "enjoying" this platformer game. So much so, that the site that I hosted it on was blocked by the school. Still though, this resounding, and unexpected success 
					led to me making more JS games and other projects, eventually making a scuffed website to act as a linking page to them. The most notable of these games being my
					Zombie Survival game.</p>
