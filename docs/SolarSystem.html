			<h1>
				Solar System Simulation
			</h1>
			<p class="generalParagraphs">
				This is a very simple model of our solar system. You can see the planets and each moon, while they're not to scale, they are at least in the right order, and also
				have their respective major moons and rings.
			</p>
			<p class="generalParagraphs">
				I made this model in highschool out of boredom. It was a wonderful exercise in Javascript and allowed me to get to know the Sine and Cosine functions more
				intimately. I've always been very interested in space, in my earlier youth I seriously wanted to become an Astronaut just so I could touch the cosmos. That dream
				is dead now, but when I was young I studied space and the universe very intensely. With the making of this website I decided to compile a few facts about the planets
				and our solar system I've learned along the way.
			</p>
			<h2>
				The Sun, the Inner Planets, and the Asteroid Belt
			</h2>
			<p class="generalParagraphs">
				In the very center of the screen you have <b>The Sun, Sol</b>, a gigantic yellow star. About 1.3 million Earths could fit inside the sun, it makes up 99.8% of the entire
				solar systems mass. It is the source of all the energy in the solar system, without it life could not exist.
			</p>
			<p class="generalParagraphs">
				The closest planet to the sun is <b>Mercury</b>. It's also (on average) the closest planet to every other planet, which doesn't make sense until you look at the math :v).
				Mercury is the smallest planet in the system, it's a small rock with an abnormally large metal core. While it's the closest to the sun, it's not the hottest, that's
				because it has no atmosphere to hold in the heat it gets. That means that the day side is very fucking hot (430C, 800F), but the night side immedietly looses all that heat
				by radiating it into space, temperatures can drop as low as -180C, or 290F.
			</p>
			<p class="generalParagraphs">
				Next up, is <b>Venus</b>, our sister planet. Venus is a hellish landscape, with a thick acidic atmosphere, you'd be crushed under 92x the pressure you feel here on Earth.
				The atmosphere is made up of extreme greenhouse gasses, most of the heat from the sun is trapped inside, and can't be radiated away, making this the hottest planet in the
				solar system, with temperatures averaging 465C (870F), that's hot enough to melt lead. Don't forget the acid rain, the atmosphere has a high sulfur content, which turns into
				sulphuric acid and rains down to the planet. On the mountains of Venus, it gets cold enough for metallic snow to form.
			</p>
			<p class="generalParagraphs">
				We're next! <b>Earth</b>, this small, insignificant speck that we call our home is the only place in the solar system that can support life. Orbiting around our planet is The Moon.
			</p>
			<p class="generalParagraphs">
				Further out is <b>Mars</b>, named after the god of war in greek mythology because of it's red color. That red hue is actually due to the desert of iron-oxide that covers the planet.
				Mars, while not volcanically active anymore, is home to Olympus Mons, the largests volcano in the solar system. It also has polar caps made of dry ice. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, named
				after twins in greek mythology who'd accompany Mars into combat.
			</p>
			<p class="generalParagraphs">
				Separating the inner and outer planet is the <b>Asteroid Belt</b>. The belt is a ring of Rocks that orbit around the Sun.
			</p>

			
			<h2>
				Outer Planets, Trojon Asteroids, and the Kuiper Belt
			</h2>
			<p class="generalParagraphs">
				I'll get to detailing these later.

			<p class="generalParagraphs">
				<b>Jupiter</b>

			<p class="generalParagraphs">
				<b>Saturn</b>
